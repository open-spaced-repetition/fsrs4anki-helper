### `days_to_reschedule`

This sets the number of days in "Reschedule cards reviewed in the last n days" (Ctrl+R); the current day included(!). Works like [searching for "rated:" in the browser](https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html?highlight=rated#answered).

## Configure via menu bar: Tools > FSRS4Anki Helper

### `free_days`

Load Balancing must be enabled for this. Select any day of the week (e.g., Sunday) that you do not want to study on. It will keep the selected day(s) free of reviews and instead select another day when rescheduling.

### `load_balance`

Fuzz must be enabled for this (default: enabled, set in the scheduler code). During rescheduling, it keeps the daily number consistent instead of fluctuating.
