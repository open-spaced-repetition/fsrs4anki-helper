### `days_to_reschedule`

This is sets the number of dasy in "Reschedule cards reviewed in the last n days" (Ctrl+R); the current day included(!). Works like [searching for "rated:" in the browser](https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html?highlight=rated#answered).

### `free_days`

Load Balancing must be enabled for this. Select Sunday if you do not want to study on this day or any other day of the week. It will keep the selected day(s) free of reviews and instead select another day when rescheduling.

### `load_balance`

Fuzz must be enabled for this (default: enabled). During rescheduling, it keeps the daily number consistent instead of fluctuating.
